## I. Definition

Predicting the stock price has been researched for long. 
Now many people try to predict stock price with the machine learning algorithms, but there is not a single answer for this and it is still challenging problem.

It is also known that every country's stock market influences each other.
In this project, I am going to predict the stock price in Japan with the data of US stock price and USD/JPY exchange rates.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the change rate of the close price of Nikkei 225 index compared to the previous day. 
Nikkei 225 is a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Japan. 

I have an hypothesis that the Nikkei 225 has a strong correlation with the close price of US stock price and JPY/USD currency exchange rate.
So, I am going to predict the change rate of the Nikkei 225 Based on its historical data, NASDAQ and USD/JPY exchange rates.

### Problem Statement

The problem I try to solve is predicting the change rate of the Nikkei 225.

The target variable is the Nikkei 225's relative change rate from the previous day.
For example, in case the Nikkei 225 index close price is "21450.04" and it was "21374.66" at the previous day, the relative change rate is ("21450.04" / "21374.66" ) â‰’ 1.00352. 
Then, it is possible to know the error between the predicted rate and the actual rate.

### Metrics

I use MSE (Mean squared error) to evaluate the prediction.
Benchmark model is made by the [DummyClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier.html).
The MSE of the prediction should be less than the benchmark score.
