## I. Definition

Predicting the stock price has been researched for long. 
Now many people try to predict stock price with the machine learning algorithms, but there is not a single answer for this and it is still challenging problem.

It is also known that every country's stock market influences each other.
In this project, I am going to predict the stock price in Japan with the data of US stock price and USD/JPY exchange rates.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the change rate of the close price of Nikkei 225 index compared to the previous day. 
Nikkei 225 is a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Japan. 

I have an hypothesis that the Nikkei 225 has a strong correlation with the close price of US stock price and JPY/USD currency exchange rate.
So, I am going to predict the change rate of the Nikkei 225 Based on its historical data, NASDAQ and USD/JPY exchange rates.

### Problem Statement

The problem I try to solve is predicting the change rate of the Nikkei 225.

The target variable is the Nikkei 225's relative change rate from the previous day.
For example, in case the Nikkei 225 index close price is "21450.04" and it was "21374.66" at the previous day, the relative change rate is ("21450.04" / "21374.66" ) â‰’ 1.00352. 
Then, it is possible to know the error between the predicted rate and the actual rate.

### Metrics

I use MSE (Mean Squared Error) to evaluate the prediction.

## II. Analysis

### Data Exploration

The data I am going to use is Nikkei 225, NASDAQ and USD/JPY currency data.

##### 1. Nikkei 225 

The data starts from January 1950 to current date. This data can be obtained at Quandl.
- https://www.quandl.com/data/NIKKEI/INDEX-Nikkei-Index

The input feature data is the change rate from the previous day of Nikkei 225.

##### 2. NASDAQ Index

The data starts from January 2003 to current date. This data can be obtained at Quandl.
- https://www.quandl.com/data/NASDAQOMX/COMP-NASDAQ-Composite-COMP

The input feature data is the change rate from the previous day of the NASDAQ index.

##### 3. Currency Exchange - JPY/USD

The data starts from March 1991 to current date. This data can be obtained at Quandl.
- https://www.quandl.com/data/CURRFX/USDJPY-Currency-Exchange-Rates-USD-vs-JPY

The input feature data is the change rate from the previous day of the JPY/USD exchange rate.

##### Currency data

```python
         Date        Rate  High (est)   Low (est)
0  2017-11-27  111.508003  111.540001  111.540001
1  2017-11-24  111.253998  111.571999  111.259003
2  2017-11-23  111.313004  111.376999  111.070999
3  2017-11-22  112.341003  112.343002  111.510002
4  2017-11-21  112.551003  112.699997  112.183998
```

All these 3 data has the close price.

Usually each market opens for the weekday, but the market is closed for the holidays and it's different between Japan and US.
So I remove the data if at lease one of the markets was closed.

### Algorithms and Techniques

The solution to this problem is to apply LSTM (Long short-term memory) to predict the Nikkei 225 index of the next day. LSTM is a one kind of the RNN (Recurrent neural network).
This is a type of time-series problem and LSTM has the advantages to solve the time-serires problem.
LSTM can remember the past values better.

I apply the technique that is called "sliding window" for time series data.
I will input the data of input_size: N (days). It will input the data within N days (including Nikkei 225, NASDAQ and currency exchange) as a feature data. 

### Benchmark

Benchmark model is made by the [DummyClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier.html).
The MSE (Mean Squared Error) of the prediction should be less than the benchmark score.

## III. Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

First step is preprocess the each data (Nikkei 225, NASDAQ and USD/JPY currency data).

```python
# main.py

# Data Preprocessing
dropping_features_for_nikkei = ['Open Price', 'High Price', 'Low Price']
dropping_features_for_nasdaq = ['High', 'Low', 'Total Market Value', 'Dividend Market Value']
dropping_features_for_currency = ['High (est)', 'Low (est)']

nikkei_data = DataPreprocessor(nikkei_data_org).preprocess_data(dropping_features_for_nikkei)
nasdaq_data = DataPreprocessor(nasdaq_data_org).preprocess_data(dropping_features_for_nasdaq)
currency_data = DataPreprocessor(currency_data_org).preprocess_data(dropping_features_for_currency)
```

Here `DataPreprocessor` class preprocess the data.
`preprocess_data` method does:
- Drop the unnecessary features
- Rename columns (to 'date' and 'ClosePrice')
- Convert string 'date' to datetime 'date'
- Calculate change rate of the close price

Next, merge all 3 data to 1 data. After that, drop the rows if the data does not have a value (because of holidays).

```python
# main.py

merged_data = DataPreprocessor.merge(nikkei_data, nasdaq_data, currency_data)
data = merged_data.dropna()
```

Preprocessed data is like this:

```python
         date    nikkei    nasdaq  currency
0  2013-01-22  0.996482  1.002702  0.993557
1  2013-01-23  0.979184  1.003337  0.988047
2  2013-01-24  1.012766  0.992615  1.000576
3  2013-01-25  1.028790  1.006175  1.022330
6  2013-01-28  0.990634  1.001457  1.000000
7  2013-01-29  1.003918  0.999797  0.992114
8  2013-01-30  1.022751  0.996401  1.003648
9  2013-01-31  1.002223  0.999943  1.002544
10 2013-02-01  1.004729  1.011766  1.007537
13 2013-02-04  1.006166  0.984923  1.000000
```
